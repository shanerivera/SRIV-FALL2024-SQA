## Activities

### Logs of forensics:
Shown in SRIV-FALL2024-SQA-LOGGER.log

### Logs of fuzzing:
Can be seen in the repo workflows, along with the output of fuzz.py in fuzzoutput.txt

### Logs of static analysis:
Log of static analysis can be seen in repo workflows with Codacy and Bandit, along with bandit's csv output in bandit_report.csv

## Actions Performed and Lessons Learned:
This was a nice project that include many different practical applications in GitHub. Having to create and clone a repo, unzip a file, add pre-commit hooks (I learned how to add post-commit hooks as well, but decided they weren't needed in the end), integrate different workflows (bandit, codacy, fuzz), and add forensics / logging. Overall, I really enjoyed this class as a whole. Everything I've done has been a lesson learned. Since I have no real-world experience in a coding environment, this was a nice setting to see how some teams can work together on a project and start to understand the structure and terminology.
